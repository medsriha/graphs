# Graphs
Implementation of Djisktra's algorithm from scratch to find single-source shortest paths in the graph and the PageRank algorithm for determining the importance of nodes in the network.


We created a Graph class that mimics some of the functionality of networkx (and which will indeed be much faster when it comes to algorithms like PageRank).
